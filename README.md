# Flashzilla
Project 17 in my 100 days of SwiftUI- Hacking with Swift journey. This is a flashcards learning app. It displays a stack of flashcards on the screen.
The flashcard will first show a prompt/question, then if tapped once by the user, the answer will slide in underneath. The user can then swipe left or right depending on if they got it correct. 
If they were correct the card will animate to green and be removed from the deck. However if they got the answer wrong, the card will go red and be replaced at the bottom of the deck for the user to try again. 
There is a timer displayed at the top for added time pressure; once the user has gone through all cards, the timer will stop and a restart button will appear.
The user may also add and delete flashcards on a seperate editing sheet.
